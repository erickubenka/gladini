# Gladini - A scalable Test Automation Selenium Grid in Kubernetes

## Deprecation Warning
Gladini was a simple Selenium 4 grid built with Kubernetes and was developed uring beta and alpha of Selenium 4.0.0. But as Selenium started to develop an own scalable grid, this repository got more and more deprecated and is not maintained anymore.
